// Iterate through ratings:

// If ratings are equal, move to the next index (no extra candies needed).

// Handle Increasing Slope (Peak Formation):

// If ratings[i] > ratings[i-1], increase the peak counter and add peak candies.

// Continue until the peak is reached.

// Handle Decreasing Slope (Dip Formation):

// If ratings[i] < ratings[i-1], increase the dip counter and add dip candies.

// Continue until the dip ends.

// Adjust Overcounting:

// The peak was counted twice (once in increasing and once in decreasing slope).

// Subtract min(peak, dip) to fix the double count.

// Return total candies.
